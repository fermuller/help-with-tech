The proposed work integrates aspects of machine learning, cyber-physical
systems, computer vision, and electronic design automation. The unique
interdisciplinary nature of this work is enabled by the highly complementary
expertise of the investigators. The  theme of the work
provides significant potential for projects in major funding
agencies, including AFOSR, DARPA, and NSF. The relevance to aerial robotics,
embedded artificial intelligence, and cyber-physical systems, are major areas of interest at these agencies.
Specific examples of relevant proposal targets include DARPA's OFFSET BAAs and  Tactile Technology Office BAAs, and NSF's National Robotics Initiative and 
Cyber-Physical Systems Programs.
We will build on the preliminary results and
interdisciplinary experience enabled by this seed grant to pursue funding
opportunities at funding agencies such as these. 

PI Bhattacharyya and Ferm\"{u}ller are both US Citizens, which provides
potential to collaborate with Northrop Grumman on a broader
variety of topics, including those with citizenship restrictions.
